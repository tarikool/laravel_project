This is a Laravel(v5.4) REST API with Authentication and CRUD functionality. It has Admin, Post and Category section and is still in development. To see the latest feature download the Repository and run the migration.
You role has to be "Administrator" to see the admin page. After registration to set your role as an Admin use this route '/insert'.
The default name of the database is "project_laravel". If you insist to use a different database for your application please be advised to change the database name in project ".env" file. 


-Thank you
